# Missing Science

Stuff science needs but isn't on Homebrew. This started out with me requiring
SVG in R, which itself relies on Cairo. Homebrew's R is built without Cairo
support (boo!). Who knows what else happens later.

The packages so far are:

- R 3.4.3, including the option to enable Cairo.
